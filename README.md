### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. parseFloat Function: the primary use of this function is to convert the users input. The users input is also known as the String, and through this function the String is converted to a Float. The users input values are converted into float so that the right values can go under the correct category. 
2. getElementById() Method: this method is important because it determines the placement of where all the final calculation results will be shown in the HTML page. This keeps the page looking organized and it helps to visualize all the calculations in one place. 
3. toFixed() Method: I learned the importance of this method in this lesson. The toFixed method is important for making sure that the right amount of number values are placed after the decimal point. With out this all the math could be wring in the calculations.
